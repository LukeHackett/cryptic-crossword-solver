\subsection{Users}

Kathryn Friedlander and Philip Fine \citep{friedlander09} carried out an
investigation into whether the amount of cryptic crosswords completed by a
solver determined how successful they were at them. 

To complete this study they gathered data from 241 people, this data can be 
used as part of research to determine the typical audience cryptic crosswords 
have. 

The following facts about the user base are taken from the results section of 
the paper \citep{friedlander09}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``209 M, 32 F''
    \item ``mean age=53 years, range=23-83''
    \item ``mean time spent=8 hours per week, range=1-30''
\end{itemize}
