\subsubsection{Substitutions}

A substitution clue involves removing letters from a word and replacing it with
another to retrieve the answer. There are two definitions within the clue, one
definition to retrieve the word to substitute letters from and another to define
the final answer.

The letter or letters to substitute are usually an abbreviation which can be
found within the clue itself. Possible indicators that denote a substitution 
clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Words which mean substitution e.g. replace, switch, exchange
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Unexciting story gets mark for length (4)} - \citep{shuchiSubstitutions08} \\
\textbf{Answer:} TAME 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``mark for length'' is an indicator for a substitution clue  
    \item ``mark'' can be abbreviated to ``m'' and ``length'' can be 
    abbreviated to ``l'', therefore replace ``l'' with ``m''
    \item ``story'' is the definition for the word which needs the substitution
    and could be defined as a tale 
    \item Replacing the ``l'' in tale with ``m'' gives the word tame which can
    also mean unexciting 
\end{itemize}
