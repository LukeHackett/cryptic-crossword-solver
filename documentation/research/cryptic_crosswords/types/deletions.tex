\subsubsection{Deletions}

Deletion clues require the solver to retrieve the answer by looking at the
definition and the word play and removing the correct letters from the correct
word. The clue will not usually have the word which needs letters removing from
it directly within the clue. Possible indicators that denote a deletion clue
are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Words to indicate letters should be removed from a certain place 
    within the word such as its first or last letter 
    \item Words to indicate certain letters should be removed from the word 
    found. These could be words that can be abbreviated 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Little shark edges away from diver's equipment (3)}  - \citep{shuchiDeletions09} \\
\textbf{Answer:} CUB 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``edges away from'' indicates that the first and the last letter 
    should be removed from the answer which comes from ``diver’s equipment''
    \item ``diver’s equipment'' is otherwise known as scuba  
    \item Removing the ``s'' and the ``a'' from scuba leaves the word cub which
    is also the answer given from the definition ``Little shark''
\end{itemize}
