\subsubsection{Pattern}

This type of clue has a definition, an indicator that the clue is of the type
pattern and a phrase or word which has the answer within them arranged as a
pattern. These patterns can be odd or even letters joined together to make a
word or possibly letters picked from regular intervals.

Pattern word play can also be joined together with other types of clues such as
charades to form a more complex answer. Possible  indicators that denote a
pattern clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Words which could mean even, odd or routine 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Beasts, free, ginned, we hear â€” regular losses there! (8)} - \citep{shuchiPicking09} \\
\textbf{Answer:} REINDEER 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``regular'' indicates it is a pattern clue as well as ``losses'' to 
    indicate the dropping of letters.
    \item ``Beasts'' is the definition.
    \item ``free, ginned, we hear'' holds the answer reindeer by picking out 
    the first ``r'' within free and each letter alternately from then on.
\end{itemize}
