\subsubsection{Palindromes}

A palindrome is a word which reads and looks the same when it is reversed. This
type of clue has an indicator and a definition.  Possible indicators that denote
a palindrome clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Phrases which may mean either way or going around in circles
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Unacceptable, going up or down (3,2)} - \citep{connorPalindromes12} \\
\textbf{Answer:} NOT ON 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``going up or down'' is an indicator as it could mean ``in either 
    direction'' like the format of a palindrome 
    \item ``Unacceptable'' is then left as the definition which gives the 
    answer, not on 
\end{itemize}
