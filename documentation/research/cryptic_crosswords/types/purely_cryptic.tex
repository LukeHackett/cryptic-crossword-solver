\subsubsection{Purely Cryptic}

Although clues within a cryptic crossword usually include both a definition and
word play, this type of clue is an exception because the whole clue is a
definition written in an unusual way.

Word play within other clue types assist the user in being able to determine
their answer is correct as well as solve them, because there is no word play
more than one answer could be found which are incorrect. Possible indicators
that denote a purely cryptic clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Question mark 
    \item Exclamation mark
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Frames for summer's activities? (5)} - \citep{shuchiCryptic08} \\
\textbf{Answer:} ABACI 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Summer'' as in a person who does mathematical sums 
    \item An abacus is a frame which holds moving beads 
    \item As the clue is plural so must the answer be, hence abaci
\end{itemize}
