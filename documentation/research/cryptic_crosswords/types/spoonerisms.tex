\subsubsection{Spoonerisms}

A spoonerism clue has a definition and word play which is usually a phrase which
describes another. This phrase, which is usually two words long, is taken and
the first letter of each is swapped around to gain a new phrase which is in turn
the answer to the clue. Possible  indicators that denote a spoonerism clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item The word ``Spooner'' or ``Spooner’s'' is placed within the clue
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Spooner's cheerful enthusiast? He'll get you across (8)} - \citep{connorSpoon12} \\
\textbf{Answer:} FERRYMAN 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Spooner’s'' indicates that this clue is a spoonerism 
    \item ``He’ll get you across'' is used as the definition 
    \item ``cheerful enthusiast'' could also be known as a merry fan 
    \item Swapping the first letters from the words merry and fan give the 
    answer ferryman 
\end{itemize}
