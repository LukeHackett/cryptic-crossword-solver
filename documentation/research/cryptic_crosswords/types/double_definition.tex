\subsubsection{Double Definition}

A double definition clue has no word play and is purely a clue with two (or
possibly more) definitions which lead to the same answer. Possible indicators
that denote a double definition clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Possibly shorter than most clues (2 or 3 words) 
    \item Although it is advisable to ignore punctuation when solving cryptic 
    clues, a double definition may have a piece of punctuation separating the 
    definitions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Robust author (5)}  - \citep{shuchiDouble08} \\
\textbf{Answer:} HARDY 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Both words are separate definitions which could both mean hardy 
\end{itemize}
