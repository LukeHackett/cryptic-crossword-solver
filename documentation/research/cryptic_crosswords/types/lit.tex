\subsubsection{``\& lit''}

``\& lit'' clues, which means ``and literally so'', is a type of clue where the
definition and the word play are the same and are not split out into separate
phrases or words as with other clues. The definition is the whole clue and the
word play can be one or more of any of the normal clue types such as anagrams
and charades. Possible indicators that denote a ``\& lit'' clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Exclamation mark
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Cop in male form (9)} - \citep{shuchiLit08} \\
\textbf{Answer:} POLICEMAN 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The whole clue is the definition 
    \item ``form'' is an indicator for an anagram clue 
    \item ``Cop in male'' can be rearranged to policeman which is also the 
    answer to a ``Cop in male form''
\end{itemize}
