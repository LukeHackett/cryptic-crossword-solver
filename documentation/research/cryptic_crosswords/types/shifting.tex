\subsubsection{Shifting}

A shifting clue has an indicator, a definition of the final answer and another
definition for the word which needs to be used to shift a letter to a different
position within the word to find the final answer.

The shifting of a letter could be moving the first letter to the last position
in the word or in a more complex clue letters could be shifted within the middle
of the word. Possible  indicators that denote a shifting clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Words e.g. shift, change, move 
    \item Phrases e.g. head to foot 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Character needs help, head to foot (4)} - \citep{shuchiShifting09} \\
\textbf{Answer:} BETA 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``head to foot'' indicates moving a letter from the front of a word 
    to the end 
    \item ``help'' is the definition for the word which requires letter 
    shifting and can also be defined as abet 
    \item Moving the first letter of ``abet'' to the end gives the word beta 
    which is a ``Character''
\end{itemize}
