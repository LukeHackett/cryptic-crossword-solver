\subsubsection{Exchange}

An exchange clue is similar to a shifting clue however instead of only one
letter shifting positions within a word, two letters within a word exchange
places to form a new word.

Typically the letters to exchange will be the first and last letters of a word
or two letters next to each other, however it is possible more than one letter
on each side will need to be swapped. 

For example, the word ``rage'' can be split into two sections ``ra'' and ``ge''
which can then be exchanged to make the word ``gear''. Possible  indicators that
denote an exchange clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Words e.g. swap, exchange, change 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Doomed king switching sides? True (4)} - \citep{shuchiExchange09} \\
\textbf{Answer:} REAL 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``switching sides'' indicates that this clue is an exchange clue 
    \item A ``Doomed king'' can also be known as a ``Lear''
    \item ``True'' is the definition which can also be defined as ``real'' 
    which can be gained by exchanging the first letter of ``Lear'' (``L'') with
    the last letter (``r'') 
\end{itemize}
