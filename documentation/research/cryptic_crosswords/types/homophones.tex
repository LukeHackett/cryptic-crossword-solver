\subsubsection{Homophones}

A homophone is a word which sounds like another word but has a separate meaning.
This type of clue has a definition, a word or phrase which means the same as the
homophone to find and an indicator. Possible indicators that denote a homophone
clue are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Words which indicate hearing or sound e.g. said, heard 
    \item Normally the indicator for a homophone is next to the word or phrase
    which is to be used to find a homophone  
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Refer to a location, reportedly (4)} - \citep{shuchiHomophone08} \\
\textbf{Answer:} CITE 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``reportedly'' is the homophone indicator 
    \item ``a location'' is the phrase which needs to be used to find a homophone 
    \item ``Refer to'' is the definition 
    \item A location can be otherwise known as a ``site'', hence cite 
\end{itemize}
