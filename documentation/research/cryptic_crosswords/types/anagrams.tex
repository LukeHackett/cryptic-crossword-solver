\subsubsection{Anagrams}

Anagram clue types have a definition, a word or phrase to indicate the clue is
of this type and an element called ``fodder''.

An anagram is a word whose letters can be rearranged to form another word;
within an anagram clue the letters to rearrange are known as ``fodder'' and are
placed next to the indicator. Possible indicators that denote an anagram clue 
are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item Words which could mean change or shifting 
    \item A clue which seems inelegantly written or a clue which contains 
    proper nouns
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} \emph{Toy breeds trained to find out a place for pearls (6,3)} - \citep{shuchiAnagram08} \\
\textbf{Answer:} OYSTER BED 

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``trained'' indicates the clue is an anagram   
    \item ``Toy breeds'' is an abnormal phrase and is the ``fodder'' of the clue 
    \item to find out a place for ``pearls'' is left to become the definition 
    \item ``Toy breeds'' is then moved around to give oyster bed 
\end{itemize}
