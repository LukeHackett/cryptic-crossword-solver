\section{Crosswords}

Arthur Wynne produced the first crossword puzzle which was printed on December
21st 1913. A crossword is a puzzle which involves the solver resolving the
answer to a clue and placing it in the correct space within the grid. 

A grid is made up of black and white squares, the black squares are blanks and 
the white squares are where the solver must place the answers. A crossword grid 
comes with a set of clues. The clues are usually arranged based upon their 
positing within the grid. Clues that that appear downwards in the grid are kept 
separate to the clues that appear across the grid. 

The white squares which are used for the first letter of an answer to a clue 
usually have a number in the top left hand corner to indicate the clue which 
links to this area of the grid.

There are different types of crosswords such as quick, cryptic and double-clue.
A quick crossword has clues which simply define the answer. A cryptic crossword
is more complex as it has word play as well as simple definitions and many
different types of clues. A double-clue crossword combines the two and allows
for a simpler option for the solver when the cryptic clues become too difficult.
