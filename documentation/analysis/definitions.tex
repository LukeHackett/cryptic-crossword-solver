\section{Problem}

A typical crossword involves a grid with black squares, not to be filled in by
the  solver, and white squares used by the solver to input their answers. The
input comes from the solver working out the answer to given clues. These clues
have an orientation, a length and a number associated with its related position
within the grid. The fundamental difference between a typical crossword and a
cryptic crossword are the clues themselves.

Cryptic crosswords are a popular type of puzzles found in many parts of the
world. Most common-wealth national newspapers will print cryptic crosswords of
varying difficulty on a daily basis.

Cryptic crosswords are a unique style of crosswords, in which the answer to
each given clue is a word puzzle. An answer can only be obtained if the cryptic
clue is read in the correct way. Often when the clue is surface read, the clue
makes no sense at all. The challenge is to find a way in which the reading of
the clue leads to a solution. To aid with solving cryptic crosswords, the clues
are written to be within specific categories, such as reversals and anagrams,
which have individual characteristics.

Many users can often become frustrated when a clue appears to be unsolvable. It
is the vast range of possible clues that often makes solving not only
challenging but interesting as well.

Fundamentally, the overall aim of this project is to develop a piece of
software that is able to solve any given type of cryptic crossword clue.

\section{Product}

Within this group project, three components will be delivered. The first 
deliverable is the final, working piece of software. Whilst the second and third
deliverables are written reports. The second deliverable is a group written 
report comprising of the all research and implementation details of the software
product. The final deliverable will be each member's individual analysis and 
evolution of the project as a whole.

Based upon the given background and problem information it could be possible to
develop a product that is able to solve the given problem.

The final product would be a piece of software that is able to understand a
given clue and try to deduce what the answer to the clue is. This would require
the software to have some form of natural language processing component as well
as one or more cryptic crossword algorithms. Once a clue has been correctly
``guessed'' it can simply be returned to the user. It is the ``guessing'' of
the answer that this project will primarily focus upon.

In order to gain maximum user coverage, the software must have an easy to use
interface. The main reason for this is that the computer literacy of the
intended users is not known - although basic computer literacy is assumed.

\section{Client \& Stakeholders}

Dr Hugh Osborne, a lecturer from the University of Huddersfield will be  the
client for the group project. Dr Hugh Osborne has a keen interest in cryptic
crosswords and the problem in the area which the group intends to help to
eliminate. The role of the client for the group project will be to input ideas
and potential requirements which Dr Hugh Osborne, as an experienced solver of
cryptic crosswords, would consider to be necessary. As a client for the project,
Dr Hugh Osborne will also be present for academic demonstrations.

Dr Gary Allen, Sotirios Batsakis and Colin Venters, all lecturers at the
University of Huddersfield, will act as stakeholders for the group project. Dr
Gary Allen will be the most involved external individual as the project
supervisor. The role of project supervisor requires frequent meetings with the
team to monitor the development of the project, provide guidance as well as
opinion on certain aspects of the life cycle.

Sotirios Batsakis and Colin Venters, will have a less active role within the
project during the project life cycle than the role of the client or the project
supervisor.  These stakeholders will play active roles at particular milestones
of the group  project such as providing guidance for the proposal of the project
and at the  project demonstration approximately half way through the life cycle.

\section{Users} 

Kathryn Friedlander and Philip Fine \citep{friedlander09} carried out an
investigation into whether the amount of cryptic crosswords completed by a
solver determined how successful they were at solving them. To complete this
study they gathered data from 241 people and have deduced the following facts 
about the user base \citep{friedlander09}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item ``209 M, 32 F''
  \item ``mean age=53 years, range=23 -- 83''
  \item ``mean time spent=8 hours per week, range=1-30''
\end{itemize}

To support decisions made within the project life cycle an additional
quantitative research method has been utilized to gain a larger understanding
of the types of users the deliverable will attract. The research method used by 
the team is in the form of a survey. 

The survey results gathered were seen as additional justifications for the 
purpose of the project. Moreover, data collected from the survey was expected to
indicate the locations in which users complete cryptic crosswords to understand 
the potential need for the deliverable to be of a transportable nature.

The following questions were asked:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do you play Cryptic Crosswords?
  \item How often do you play?
  \item Where do you play?
  \item Do you often finish them?
  \item If no to the previous question, what reason don't you finish them?
  \item What is your age group?
  \item When do you play Cryptic Crosswords?
  \item What gender are you?
  \item What is the Highest qualification you have?
  \item What platform is your mobile phone on?
\end{enumerate}

The survey was conducted between (date) and (date). It was distributed across
the the University of Huddersfield portal message board, Facebook and Twitter. 
The results of this survey are shown in figure \ref{fig:graphs_1_6} and figure 
\ref{fig:graphs_7_10}.
