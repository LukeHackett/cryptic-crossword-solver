\section{Defining the Problem}

Many users can often become frustrated when a clue appears to be unsolvable. It
is the vast range of possible clues that often makes solving not only 
challenging but interesting as well.

Fundamentally, the overall aim of this project is to develop a piece of 
software that is able to solve any given type of cryptic crossword clue.

algorithms, it should be possible to generate an answer to a given clue.
