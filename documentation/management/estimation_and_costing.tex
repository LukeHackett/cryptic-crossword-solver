\section{Estimation and Costing} 
\label{sec:estimation_and_costing}

The costs of a software development project are primarily the costs of the effort involved. The three main areas which correspond to the cost of a software project include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hardware and software costs including maintenance
	\item Travel and training costs
	\item Effort costs (Costs of paying software engineers).
\end{itemize}

The main cost that will be discussed in this section is the effort costs as this is the most adequate cost that can be calculated for this project. In order to estimate the project costs the volume of the software must be calculated. This can be done by calculating number of Source lines of Code(SLOC) also calculated as Thousands of lines of Code (KLOC). The most common estimating metric is the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) and the new COCOMO II. Function points is another metrics that can be used to estimate the project. 

COCOMO was originally devloped by \citet{see81}. It has since been re-developed as COCOMO II \citep{cocomo2}. 

The basic COCOMO formula is:

Effort Applied (Person Months)
\[
	E=a(KLOC)^{b}
\]

Development Time(Months)
\[
	DT=cE^{d}
\]

People Required
\[
	P=E/D
\]

\begin{table}[H]
  	\centering
  	\small
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    Mode          & a   & b    & c   & d    \\ \hline
    Organic       & 2.4 & 1.05 & 2.5 & 0.38 \\ \hline
    Semi Detached & 3.0 & 1.12 & 2.5 & 0.35 \\ \hline
    Embeded       & 3.6 & 1.20 & 2.5 & 0.32 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption {Basic COCOMO}
\end{table}

The cryptic solver best suits the Organic mode because the team is small consisting of four members who have experience working with requirements. On this basis and the time constraint factors the project can be estimated. The development time allocated for the project is 3.25 months which is the 98 days calculated from the project plan. This has been considered to exclude time for other academic deliverables and to mainly focus upon the actual development. There fore according to \citet{cocomo2} the project can be estimated as followed:

Effort Applied (Person Months)
\[
	E=2.4(5)^{1.05} = 13
\]
Development Time (Months)
\[
	DT=2.5(13)^{0.38} = 6.5 
\]
People Required
\[
	P=13/6.5 = 2
\]

Now to evaluate this against the number of actual team members we can do the following.

Development Time (Months)
\[
	DT=2.5(13)^{0.38}/2 = 3.25
\]
People Required
\[
	P=13/3.25 = 4
\]


The estimated number of lines of code SLOC is therefore 5(thousand). Upon completion of the project the COCOMO model was applied to see how closely the original estimation was made. In total there are 5721 SLOC and therefore applying the same algorithms as before produced the following results.

Effort Applied (Person Months)
\[
	E=2.4(6)^{1.05} = 15
\]
Development Time (Months)
\[
	DT=2.5(13)^{0.38}/2 = 3.5
\]
People Required
\[
	P=15/3.5 = 4
\]
