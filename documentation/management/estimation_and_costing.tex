\section{Estimation and Costing} 
\label{sec:estimation_and_costing}

The costs of a software development project are primarily the costs of the effort involved. The three main areas which correspond to the cost of a software project include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hardware and software costs including maintenance
	\item Travel and training costs
	\item Effort costs (Costs of paying software engineers).
\begin{end}

The main cost that will be discussed in this section is the effort costs as this is the most adequate cost that can be calculated for this project. In order to estimate the project costs the volume of the program must be calculated. This can be done by calculating number of Source lines of Code(SLOC). The most common estimating metric is the Constructive Cost Model(COCOMO) and the new COCOMO II therefore these will be used to estimate the costs. Function points is another metrics that can be used to estimate the project there fore this will also be used to estimate the costs. Finally a calculation will be made from the final product and compare the results of how accurate the original estimation was.
