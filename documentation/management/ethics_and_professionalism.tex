\section{Ethics and Professionalism} 
\label{sec:ethics_and_professionalism}

In software engineering ethics is the study of right and wrong in relation to human actions \citep{profissues01}. The participants of the group project have looked at all aspects of ethical thinking as well as professionalism throughout the course of the project. The group members adopted the ethical codes in order to demonstrate their professionalism within the academic institution and to re-enforce these skills in the working industry. The seven main functions of ethical thinking that were looked at are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Professionalism
	\item Protection of group interests
	\item Etiquette and inspiration
	\item Education
	\item Enforcement
	\item Principles, ideals and rules
	\item Rights - Obligations and duties as well as the rights of members and the obligation of the professional body to its members. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Professional Codes of Conduct}

As students of an engineering degree each participant is a member of the British Computing Society(BCS). As a member of this professional body each member adheres to the rules which cover four main areas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Public interest
	\item Professional competence and integrity
	\item Duty to relevant Authority
	\item Duty to the profession
\end{itemize}

For the purpose of the project the duties of each member of the team has been to ensure that the all work, research has been conceptual, empirical and fully technical. As well as sticking to the BCS code of conduct the team members are aware of the Student Handbook at the University of Huddersfield and are obliagted to follow these rules and regualtions set out in this handbook.

\subsection{Intellectual Property Rights}

The cryptic crossword solver is an academic application which is formally a prototype to a real world problem. The decision has been taken by each team member that there will be no claims for rights to the application and its documents and after the marks have been awarded from the examining board the application is to be published as an open source project. 

The project does not contain any confidential information which are internal to the software engineering team and external to the clients. The members of the group have also adhered to the Copyright, Patents and Designs Act 1988 and ensured that all material used within the project is of their own and permission has been granted from the relevant authorities such as the Guardian newspaper to ensure that there are no conflicts in the code, design and documentation of the project. 

\subsection{Computer Misuse}

The members of the team are aware of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and have followed the correct procedures to ensure that all material that has been generated has been lawfully generated under the correct and legal environments of the University grounds and at the students home. Again mentioning the Guardian Newspaper and the data that was collected from their website the team members ensured to make sure that permission was obtained and this can be found in the appendix. To provision the project the credentials for access to the Helios server and the Amazon EC2 server have been maintained by the all users ensuring not to share this information to anyone other than the team members them selfs.
