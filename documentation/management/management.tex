\chapter{Project Management}
\label{cha:project_management}

The management of projects has evolved to become more complex and diverse as
technology grows. One common characteristic shared by all projects is the
projection of activities and ideas. The management of a project allows the
explicit control of resources and budget as well as a coordinated path for a
successful project \citep{projMan86}.

This chapter consists of the management resources that were deployed within the
project. The chapter includes the initial plans developed for the project as
well as the accurate and concise plans of the project which were changed on a
constant basis to apprehend the need of the clients, the users, and the
development team of the project. Further more the psychology of the development
is briefly discussed to illustrate the change in the life cycle of the project.
