\section{Purpose}

\subsection{Background of the Project}

The purpose of this project is to produce an app that will be compatible with the three main mobile operating systems, iOS, Android and Blackberry OS. The app is to be able to solve given clues from cryptic crosswords which are widely available on publications such as the Burgundian newspaper. There is no current form mobile application in the current market which solves cryptic clues. The produced product is to allow the end user to solve some if not all types of clues which have been discussed in section 2.1.3.

\subsection{Project Goals}

The main goals of the project are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Be able to solve a given clue.
  \item Identify the type of clue it is.
  \item Show a stack trace of how the clue was deduced.
  \item Be able to store previous solved clues. 
\end{enumerate}
