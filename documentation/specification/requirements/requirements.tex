\chapter{Software Specification} 
\label{chap:requirements} 

\citet{robertson13} state that `a requirement is something the product must 
do to support its owner's business, or a quality it must have to make it 
acceptable and attractive to the owner.' The aim of gathering the requirements 
is to ensure that all ambiguities are removed before a product is developed.

Within this chapter the project's aims and objectives will be outlined, as well 
as project constraints and assumptions.Software requirements will be categorised
as functional and non-functional requirements, to which a full MoSCoW analysis 
will be conduced.

Finally a risk assessment into the various project related risks will be 
conducted to help identify any potential risks. The risk assessment will also 
identify how the risks can be reduced.
