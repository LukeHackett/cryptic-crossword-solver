\section{Agile}

The agile software development methodology is designed to ``reduce risk by 
delivering software systems in short bursts or releases'' \citep{dawson09}.

Each release (sometimes referred to as iterations) will involve minimal 
planning and will cover all the major SDLC components: analysis, design, 
implementation and testing. The agile development model also heavily promotes 
collaboration/development between team members \citep{dawson09}. 


\subsection{Advantages}

One of the main advantages of using the agile development model is that 
software is developed in rapid cycles, which ultimately results in smaller 
constant incremental releases of software. As well as this major advantage, 
\citet{dawson09} states the following advantages of using the agile development 
model:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The methodology surrounds the concept of regular face-to-face meetings 
  as opposed to in-depth documentation
  \item Utilises a close working relationship between the client and the 
  developers, thus providing continuous delivery of useful software
  \item Uses shorter, iterative time scales (usually weeks rather than months 
  or years), which results in working software being delivered frequently
  \item Easily able to change the requirements at any stage (however late the 
  changes are)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Disadvantages}

However many of the disadvantages of agile development model are surrounded by 
the lack of a rigid documentation, as \citet{dawson09} also suggests the following 
disadvantages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item There is often a lack of emphasis on necessary documentation (user 
  documentation, design documentation etc.), which is normally skipped to save 
  time
  \item The uncertainty of a specification may lead to poor code and/or 
  structure
  \item The project can become confused if the original specification is not 
  clear from the start
  \item Some software deliverables can be difficult to allocate the correct 
  amount of resources (time, effort etc.) at the start of the project
\end{itemize}
