\section{Feasibility Study}

A feasibility study will be carried out to identify the difficulty of the
 implementation needed for each type of cryptic crossword clue with
 the aid of the research carried out previously. The study will focus
 on the resources needed for each implementation which will contribute
 to the level of difficulty for each clue type. Furthermore, using the 
previous research resources within the cryptic crossword field, a measurement
 of how common each clue type is within a cryptic crossword will be presented
 to assist in the understanding of the necessity of the clue type within the project.

Aspects such as how common clue types are featured within research
 resources and how regular indicators are found in the project test data
 will contribute to the judgement made on how regular a type of clue is. The
 justification of the use of specific resources for a clue type will come from
 research resources and inspecting project test data.
