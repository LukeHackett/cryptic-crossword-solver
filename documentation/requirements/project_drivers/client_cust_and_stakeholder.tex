\subsection{The Customer}

The intended customer of the product are users of smartphone and tablets whom are looking to solve all those unsolvable Cryptic Crosswords. The applications will be deployed on the app market for the three listed mobile operating systems which means that the app will be available to anyone who has a compatible device with the required software. The physical deployment of the application is out of the project scope so a price for the deployment will not be discussed.
