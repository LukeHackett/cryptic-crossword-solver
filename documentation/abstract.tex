Cryptic crosswords are a unique style of crosswords in which the answer to each
given clue is a word puzzle. An answer can only be obtained if the cryptic clue
is read in the correct way. Often when the clue is surface read, the clue makes
no sense at all. The challenge is to find a way in which the reading of the 
clue leads to a solution.

Cryptic crosswords are a popular type of puzzle found in many parts of the 
world. Most of the national UK newspapers will print cryptic crosswords of 
varying difficulty on a daily basis. Many users can often become frustrated 
when a clue appears to be unsolvable.


Clues that appear to be unsolvable are often all part of the fun of cryptic 
crosswords. However each clue can take some time to solve due to the fact that 
there are many forms of wordplay.
