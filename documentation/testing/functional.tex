\section{Functional Testing}
\label{sec:functional_testing}

The purpose of the functional testing is to take all the requirements apart from 
the non-functional requirements and determine whether they have been achieved 
from the final system. This section will take all the requirements from the Functional 
Requirements MoSCoW analysis section and the Usibility Requirements MoSCoW analysis 
section and provide evidence of the requirements being fulfilled. If the requirements have 
not been implemented, an explanation will be delivered as to the reasons why.

\subsection{Usability Requirements}
\label{sub:test_func_usability}

 \paragraph{Provide a text field for the user to input the cryptic clue to be}
  A text field has been added to the interface to allow the user to enter a cryptic clue. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	 \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/enterclue.png}
	\caption{Text field to enter clue}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Fully Implemented

 \paragraph{Provide a drop-down box allowing the user to input the
number of words in the solution, with an initial upper-
limit of 10 words}

 A text field has been provided instead of a drop-down box which allows the user
 to input the number of words as well as the length of the words. The limit on the 
amount of words input by the user has not been implemented, however the user 
can only input words of length up to fifteen. This is because a traditional cryptic 
crossword has a typical size of 15x15.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/dropdown1.png}
	\caption{Attempting to enter a length of sixteen - the red colour signifies it is invalid}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/dropdown2.png}
	\caption{Attempting to enter two words of length fifteen - the green colour signifies it is valid}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/dropdown3.png}
	\caption{Attempting to enter three words of valid length with a space and a hyphen - the green 
colour signifies it is valid}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Alternatively Implemented

\paragraph{Dynamically provide individual text boxes for each word
of the solution, which allow the length of the words to be
specified. Also provide check-boxes between these text-
boxes to define whether they are separated by a space
or a hyphen}

See `Provide a drop-down box allowing the user to input the
number of words in the solution, with an initial upper-
limit of 10 words'.

{\bf Overall:} Alternatively Implemented

\paragraph{Dynamically provide text boxes to represent each char-
acter of each word of the solution, allowing the user to
input any known characters}

Text boxes are dynamically created depending on the values input into 
the `Solution Length' field. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,scale=0.9]{evidence/dynamicboxes.png}
	\caption{Boxes that have been generated for a solution with the configuration; 2-3,2}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Fully Implemented

\paragraph{Provide a table of results which allow the user the to
view the possible solutions}

When the results are returned to the user, they are displayed within a table 
underneath the fields containing the users input. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,scale=0.6]{evidence/listsolutions.png}
	\caption{Results displayed for the clue; `A clever rhyme or subtle teaser I constitute'}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:}: Fully Implemented

\paragraph{Alert the user to required fields with red asterisks}
   A design decision was made to change the colour of the label text 
and the outline of the text box if the user clicks `Submit' without filling in
 required fields.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/alert1.png}
	\caption{If the user submits without filling in either required fields}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/alert2.png}
	\caption{If the user submits without filling in the length of the solution}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/alert3.png}
	\caption{If the user submits without filling in the clue field}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Alternatively Implemented

\paragraph{Have a consistent layout avoid unnecessary scrolling}
    All pages within the website have the same colour scheme and fonts 
with an additional consistency with menu items and bars. The web page 
has also been implemented to resize to the browser window. This means 
there is no scrolling for full screen browser windows and limited horizontal 
scrolling for smaller browser windows as the controls are moved into a linear 
position. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,scale=0.4]{evidence/scrolling.png}
	\caption{Web page in full screen browser window}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,scale=0.5]{evidence/scrolling1.png}
	\caption{Web page in resized browser window}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Fully Implemented

\paragraph{Alert the user to invalid input through validation checks
with error messages} 
     When the user clicks `Submit' without completing the required fields 
the styling of the label and text fields change colour to red and the page 
does not proceed to pass invalid data to the back end code. 

See `Alert the user to required fields with red asterisks' for evidence'.

{\bf Overall:} Alternatively Implemented 

\paragraph{Provide a confidence rating in the table of possible solutions}

The confidence rating calculated whilst retrieving possible solutions is displayed 
alongside the solution.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/confidence.png}
	\caption{Confidence ratings displayed with the solutions returned}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Fully Implemented

\paragraph{Allow the user to select a proposed solution in the corresponding table and mark this as correct}

{\bf Overall:} Not Implemented

\paragraph{Display help buttons to indicate to the user the purpose
and use of each control}

Instead of implementing buttons to display help for each of the controls on the web page, 
a user manual has been created which can be accessed through the menu bar. This explains 
the web page functionality as well as some additional information on the web service. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/manual.png}
	\caption{Introduction to the user manual}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Alternatively Implemented

\paragraph{Provide a button to submit the user input to the appli-
cation for processing}

A submit button has been provided for the user to click when they have input 
the clue itself and the clues length. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{evidence/submit.png}
	\caption{Submit button for user to click}
\end{figure}

{\bf Overall:} Fully Implemented

\paragraph{Provide a group of radio buttons for the user to select
the clue's orientation in its containing crossword}

There has been no functionality implemented to use the clue's orientation 
within the solver algorithms, therefore it was unnecessary to implement 
radio buttons for the user to select the orientation of the clue. 

{\bf Overall:} Not Implemented

\paragraph{Provide a text box to input the clue's number within its
containing crossword}

There has been no functionality implemented to use the clue's grid number 
within the solver algorithms, therefore it was unnecessary to implement 
a text box for the user to input the grid number of the clue. 
 
{\bf Overall:} Not Implemented

\paragraph{Provide mechanisms to accommodate for users with dif-
ficulties, such as colour-blindness or poor eyesight}
    
There has been no specific functionality implemented to accommodate for 
users with difficulties. However, the user can disable CSS on their browser
 to view the web page with no styling. 

{\bf Overall:} Not Implemented
