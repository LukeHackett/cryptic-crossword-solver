\label{cha:testing}

The testing phase was an ongoing process to adhere to the guidelines of agile
development which has been used throughout the project. The development phase
was split across three iterations meaning at the end of each, JUnit tests were
written  and run to ensure all functionality for each iteration was working
correctly. This meant  any functionality being added in the new iteration using
the functionality written in a previous  iteration would not be delayed as
previous code was reliable and complete.

At the end of development, functional testing and walkthroughs of the user
interface  were completed. The functional testing took all functional
requirements declared at the beginning  of the project to ensure they were all
fulfilled and working correctly. The walkthroughs of the  user interface
involved testing input into the system to determine whether the system would
fall over with various valid and invalid input entered.

The following chapter will document all the testing discussed above including
descriptions of  the processes completed and evidence of the system passing
various tests with different  test strategies.
