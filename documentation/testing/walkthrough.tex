%% Testing :: Walk-through
%%%
\section{Walk-through}
\label{sec:walkthroughs}

The previous section focused upon automated unit tests that were able to 
programmatically deduce the correctness of output. Although unit testing is a 
major part of the overall testing strategy it is not the only strategy.

Within this section a number of objective based software walk-throughs will be 
conducted. A software walk-through is an analysis technique that requires all 
interested parties to ask questions and make comments about possible anomalies, 
violation of development standards, and other problems \citep{ieee08}.

As described within the development section, the user interface makes use of 
JavaScript, and hence there will be two walk-throughs, one with JavaScript 
enabled and another with JavaScript disabled.

\subsubsection{Non-JavaScript} % (fold)
\label{ssub:non_javascript}

As part of the testing process, the user interface's default view will be tested
through a series of walk-throughs. These tests are designed to test to ensure
that a user is unable to break the user interface.

All of the tests shown in table \ref{tbl:nonjs_tests} were conducted in a 
browser that had JavaScript disabled.

\subsubsection{JavaScript}
\label{ssub:javascript}

As described within the development section, the user interface by default will
use JavaScript to reduce the amount of input the user is required to do. It also
adds to the user experience, by removing the requirement for some pages to be 
`reloaded'.

Within this subsection, a number of software walk-throughs will be conducted 
with JavaScript enabled. This will test the additional layer of functionality 
that is brought by using JavaScript. Table \ref{tbl:js_tests} outlines the 
results of each of the tests.
