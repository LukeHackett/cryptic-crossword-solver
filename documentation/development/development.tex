\label{cha:development}

The development phase was split across three `iterations'. Each iteration would
add and improve upon existing functionality. In order to keep the documentation
as compact as possible, this chapter will only focus upon the final development 
phase. This will ensure that the contents of this chapter is in line with the 
latest development phase and source code.

This chapter will focus upon the user interface development and how it interacts
with the Java Servlets. There will also be signification focus upon the `back 
end' system, including how a clue is solved and how the solvers interact with 
various resources such as dictionaries and thesauri. 

Finally the overall system architecture will be discussed, proving an insight 
into it's development and how it has added to the overall product.
